Publisher Compliance RCUK OA Cambridge 2013-14

This Excel spreadsheet summarises data concerning the payment of Article Processing Charges for Open Access from the RCUK publication fund at the University of Cambridge for the year Apr 2013 to Mar 2014. The data includes only articles that have been invoiced and that have been published. Cases where we have paid an APC but the article has not yet been published are not included; nor are commitments which have not yet been invoiced.

The amount paid includes VAT and is in pounds (converted using web-sourced exchange rates at the time of invoice). For APCs invoiced in other currencies the amount paid will reflect variations in exchange rate. The amount paid may also include any discounts for which the article was eligible.

Explanation of the data

Publisher: is the publisher as recorded on the APC invoice.

Article: is the article title information entered into our tracking system by the author

Journal: is the journal name entered into our tracking system by the author, aided by a reference data set from Sherpa ROMEO

DOI: is the identifier obtained from the invoice or found by search for the article title and recorded from the publisher website

Invoice Date: is the date of the invoice

Amount Paid: is the amount paid by Cambridge. Normally this is the full amount of the APC as we operate a 'knock for knock' policy with other universities and pay the full amount if the corresponding author is from Cambridge. If the corresponding author is not from the UK, then we will pay in full if any author is from Cambridge. We rely on the publisher to not charge us if another university has already paid. Some publishers have discount schemes. We typically do not subscribe to discount schemes, but we do reimburse 1 year  author membership of American Chemical Society to obtain their substantial discount for members and we are members of the Royal Society Open Access scheme. Where an APC fee has been split between Wellcome Trust publication fund and the RCUK publication fund we show the total APC fee paid by Cambridge.

The set of columns labelled ‘First Publication’ tracks the status of the article when it was first made available online.

Open Access: records whether the article is available at all as ‘free to read’. If the article is available to subscribers but not to other users, this will be flagged as ‘N’.

Correct licence: records whether the article is correctly labelled as CC BY, the licence required by RCUK policy. Articles that are given a different licence, such as CC BY-NC-ND, or without a licence label at all, will be flagged as ‘N’.

Access charges: records whether the publisher is charging for access. This differs from the ‘Open Access’ status in that in some cases publishers have made articles available on one of their websites while charging on another, without notifying the user that they could get it for free elsewhere. This mainly concerns Elsevier articles.

Status is rechecked for unsatisfactory articles on a weekly basis and updated if changed. Once an article reaches satisfactory status it is not re-checked. 

The set of columns labelled ‘Current Status’ record the situation at the last check, which took place from 31 March to 3 April.

The final column, ‘Problem-free OA publication’ summarises whether the process went smoothly. A red flag in any of the previous boxes will set this to ‘N’.

Overall statistics and those for our largest publishers are given on the second worksheet.
